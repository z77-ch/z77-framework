/**
 * Session-based abuse protection for public forms — the generic mechanics every
 * public form needs, extracted from the first consumer (zihlundsee contact
 * form; see docs/03-development/review-email-service-usage.md §1a):
 *
 *   - Time-trap: armTimeTrap() on every form render (idempotent — a re-render
 *     keeps the running window), disarmTimeTrap() when the submit completed;
 *     isTooFast() treats a submit without a render timestamp (direct POST) or
 *     faster than $minSeconds as a bot. The caller decides the reaction
 *     (convention: pretend success, send nothing).
 *   - Rate limit: recordSend() after each successful send; isRateLimited()
 *     caps successful sends per session within a sliding one-hour window.
 *
 * No confirmation flag: the PRG target is a REAL page of its own (a thank-you
 * action), not the form page rendering something else because a session flag
 * says so — see docs/topics/forms.md.
 *
 * Honeypot fields stay on the form DTO (field names differ per form); this
 * guard covers the session-side mechanics only. Not a DI singleton — built per
 * form key via forKey() (placement decision B, like Mailer/DocumentService).
